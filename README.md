# YAKL: Yet Another Kernel Launcher
## A Simple C++ Framework for Performance Portability and Fortran Code Porting

**Please see the [Issues](https://github.com/mrnorman/YAKL/issues) page for coming features.**

**YAKL is still a work in progress, and the API is still in flux. Currently this only supports the E3SM-MMF Exascale Computing Project (ECP) application. It is not intended to compete with the more functional portability frameworks. YAKL has a focus on Fortran porting, simplicity, and readability.**

## Overview

The YAKL API is similar to Kokkos in many ways, but is fairly simplified and has must stronger Fortran interoperability and Fortran-like options. YAKL currently has backends for CPUs (serial), Nvidia GPUs, and AMD GPUs. With around 6K lines of code, YAKL provides the following:

* **Pool Allocator**: A pool allocator for all `memDevice` `Array`s in accelerator memory
  * Supports `malloc`, `cudaMalloc`, `cudaMallocManaged`, `hipMalloc`, and `hipMallocHost` allocators
  * CUDA Managed memory also calls `cudaMemPrefetchAsync` on the entire pool
  * If the pool allocator is not used, YAKL still maintains internal host and device allocators with the afforementioned options
  * Specify `-D__MANAGED__` to turn on `cudaMallocManaged` for Nvidia GPUs and `hipMallocHost` for AMD GPUs
  * Controllable via environment variables (initial size, grow size, and to turn it on or off)
* **Fortran Bindings**: Fortran bindings for the YAKL internal / pool device allocators
  * For `real(4)`, `real(8)`, `int(4)`, `int(8)`, and `logical` arrays up to seven dimensions
  * Using Fortran bindings for Managed memory makes porting from Fortran to C++ on the GPU significantly easier
  * You can call `gator_init()` from `gator_mod` to initialize YAKL's pool allocator from Fortran code.
  * Call `gator_finalize()` to deallocate YAKL's runtime pool and other miscellaneous data
  * When you specify `-D__MANAGED__ -D__USE_CUDA__`, all `gator_allocate(...)` calls will not only use CUDA Managed Memory but will also map that data in OpenACC and OpenMP offload runtimes so that the data will be left alone in the offload runtimes and left for the CUDA runtime to manage instead.
    * This allows you to use OpenACC and OpenMP offload without any data statements and still get efficient runtime and correct results.
    * This is accomplished with `acc_map_data(...)` in OpenACC and `omp_target_associate_ptr(...)` in OpenMP 4.5+
    * With OpenACC, this happens automatically, but with OpenMP offload, you need to also specify `-D_OPEMP45`
* **Fortran Intrinsics**: To help the code look more like Fortran when desired
  * A library of Fortran intrinsic functions (a reduced set, not all Fortran intrinsics)
  * Most intrinsics operator on Fortran-style and C-style arrays on the heap and on the stack
  * Some intrinsics (like `pack`) only operate in host memory
* **Multi-Dimensional Arrays**: A C-style `Array` class for allocated multi-dimensional array data
  * Only one memory layout is supported for simplicity: contiguous with the right-most index varying the fastest
    * This makes library interoperability more straightforward
  * Up to eight dimensions are supported
  * `Array`s support two memory spaces, `memHost` and `memDevice`, specified as a template parameter.
  * The `Array` API is similar to a simplified Kokkos `View`
  * `Array`s use shallow move and copy constructors (sharing the data pointer rather than copying the data) to allow them to work in C++ Lambdas via capture-by-value in a separate device memory address space.
  * `Array`s automatically use the YAKL pool allocator unless the user turns the pool off via an environment variable
  * `Array`s are by default "owned" (allocated, reference counted, and deallocated), but there are "non-owned" constructors that can wrap existing data pointers
  * Both C and Fortran style `Array`s allow simple array "slicing"
  * Supports array index debugging to throw an error when indices are out of bounds or the wrong number of dimensions is used
* **Multi-Dimensional Arrays On The Stack**: An `SArray` class for static arrays to be placed on the stack
  * This makes it easy to create low-overhead private arrays in kernels
  * Supports up to four dimensions, the sizes of which are template parameters known at compile time
    * CPU code allows runtime-length stack arrays, but most accelerators do not allow this
  * Supports array index debugging to throw an error when indices are out of bounds
  * Because `SArray` objects are inherently on the stack, they have no templated memory space specifiers
* **Fortran-style Multi-dimensional Arrays**: Fortran-style `Array` and `FSArray` classes
  * Left-most index varies the fastest just like in Fortran (still has a contiguous memory layout)
  * Arbitrary lower bounds that default to one but can vary to any integer
  * `parallel_for` kernel launchers that take arbitrary loop bounds and strides like Fortran loops
    * Lower bounds of loops default to one, and by default includes the upper bound in iterations (like Fortran `do` loops)
  * Contains a `slice()` function to allow simple contiguous Fortran-like array slices
  * Removes the need to permute array indices and change indexing when porting Fortran codes to C++
* **Kernel Launchers**: `parallel_for` launchers
  * Similar syntax as the Kokkos `parallel_for`
  * Only supports one level of parallelism for simplicity, so your loops need to be collapsed
    * Once you begin to expose multiple levels of on-node parallelism, you have inherently given up some ground in terms of portability
  * Multiple tightly-nested loops are supported through the `Bounds` class, which sets multiple looping indices for the kernel
  * C-style and Fortran-style `parallel_for` functions and `Bounds` classes
    * C-style defaults to: `parallel_for( nx , YAKL_LAMBDA (int i) {` --> `for (int i=0; i < nx; i++) {`
    * FOrtran-style defaults to: `parallel_for( nx , YAKL_LAMBDA (int i) {` --> `for (int i=1; i <= nx; i++) {`, which is the same as a Fortran `do`-loop
  * Supports CUDA, CPU serial, and HIP backends at the moment
  * `parallel_for` launchers on the device are by default asynchronous in the CUDA and HIP default streams
  * There is an automatic `fence()` option specified at compile time with `-D__AUTO_FENCE__` to insert fences after every `parallel_for` launch
* **NetCDF I/O**:
  * Simplified NetCDF reading and writing utilities to get dimension sizes, tell if dimensions and variables exist, and write data either as entire varaibles or as a single entry with an `unlimited` NetCDF dimension.
  * You can write an entire variable at once, or you can write just one entry in an unlimited (typically time) dimension
* **Atomics**: Atomic instructions
  * `atomicAdd`, `atomicMin`, and `atomicMax` are supported for 4- and 8-byte integers (signed and unsigned) and reals
  * Whenever possible, hardware atomics are used, and software atomics using `atomicCAS` and real-to-integer conversions in the CUDA and HIP backends
  * Note this is different from Kokkos, which specifies atomic accesses for entire Views all of the time. With YAKL, you only perform atomic accesses when you need them at the development expense of having to explicitly use `atomic[Add|Min|Max]` in the kernel code yourself.
* **Reductions**: Parallel reductions using the Nvidia `cub` and AMD `hipCUB` (wrapper to `rocPRIM`) libraries
  * Temporary data for a GPU device reduction is allocated with YAKL's internal device allocators and owned by a class for your convenience. It is automatically deallocated when the class falls out of scope. The user neither sees nor handles allocations needed for the library calls.
  * The user can create a class object and then reuse it to avoid multiple allocations during runtime
  * If the pool allocator is turned on, allocations are fast either way
  * The `operator(T *data)` function defaults to copying the result of the reduction to a host scalar value
  * The user can also use the `deviceReduce(T *data)` function to store the result into a device scalar location
* **Scalar Live-Out**: When a device kernel needs to return a scalar that depends on calculations in the kernel, the scalar has to be allocated in device memory. YAKL has a `ScalarLiveOut` class that makes this more convenient.
  * This is perhaps the most obscure among common issues encountered in GPU porting, but scalars that are assigned in a kernel and used outside the kernel must be allocated in device memory (perhaps using a 1-D YAKL `Array` of size 1), and the data must be copied from device to host once the kernel is done.
  * This situation happens most often with testing kernels; i.e., a `bool` decides if the data is valid or not, and it is read on the host outside the kernel.
  * `ScalarLiveOut` allows normal assignment with the `=` operator inside a kernel (so it looks like a normal scalar in the kernel).
  * `ScalarLiveOut` is initialized from the host via a constructor that allocates on the device and copies initial data the device behind the scenes
  * `ScalarLiveOut` allows reads on the host with a `hostRead()` member function that copies data from the device to the host behind the scenes.
* **Synchronization**
  * The `yakl::fence()` operation forces the host code to wait for all device code to complete

## Code Sample

The following loop would be ported to general accelerators with YAKL as follows:

```C++
#include "Array.h"
#include "YAKL.h"
#include <iostream>
typedef float real;
typedef yakl::Array<real,4> real4d;
void applyTendencies(real4d &state2, real const c0, real4d const &state0,
                                     real const c1, real4d const &state1,
                                     real const ct, real4d const &tend,
                                     Domain const &dom) {
  real tot = 0;
  for (int l=0; l<numState; l++) {
    for (int k=0; k<dom.nz; k++) {
      for (int j=0; j<dom.ny; j++) {
        for (int i=0; i<dom.nx; i++) {
          state2(l,hs+k,hs+j,hs+i) = c0 * state0(l,hs+k,hs+j,hs+i) +
                                     c1 * state1(l,hs+k,hs+j,hs+i) +
                                     ct * dom.dt * tend(l,k,j,i);
          tot += state2(l,hs+k,hs+j,hs+i);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
std::cout << state2;
std::cout << tot << std::endl;
```

will become:


```C++
#include "Array.h"
#include "YAKL.h"
#include <iostream>
typedef float real;
typedef yakl::Array<real,4,yakl::memDevice> real4d;
void applyTendencies(real4d &state2, real const c0, real4d const &state0,
                                     real const c1, real4d const &state1,
                                     real const ct, real4d const &tend,
                                     Domain const &dom) {
  // for (int l=0; l<numState; l++) {
  //   for (int k=0; k<dom.nz; k++) {
  //     for (int j=0; j<dom.ny; j++) {
  //       for (int i=0; i<dom.nx; i++) {
  yakl::c::parallel_for( yakl::c::Bounds<4>(numState,dom.nz,dom.ny,dom.nx) ,
                         YAKL_LAMBDA (int l, int k, int j, int i) {
    state2(l,hs+k,hs+j,hs+i) = c0 * state0(l,hs+k,hs+j,hs+i) +
                               c1 * state1(l,hs+k,hs+j,hs+i) +
                               ct * dom.dt * tend(l,k,j,i);
  }); 
  real tot = yakl::intrinsics::sum( state2 );
}
std::cout << state2.createHostCopy();
std::cout << tot << std::endl;
```

## Using YAKL

To use YAKL's Array classes, `parallel_for` launchers, reductions, allocators, and atomics, you only need to `#include "YAKL.h"`. For NetCDF I/O routines, you need to `#include "YAKL_netcdf.h"`. For YAKL's FFTs, you need to `#include "YAKL_fft.h"`.

Be sure to use `yakl::init(...)` at the beginning of the program and `yakl::finalize()` at the end. If you do not call these functions, you will get errors during runtime for all `Array`s, `SArray`s, and device reductions.

### `parallel_for`

Preface functions you want to run on the accelerator with `YAKL_INLINE`, and preface loop bodies you're passing to YAKL launchers with `YAKL_LAMBDA` (which does a capture by value for CUDA and HIP backends for Nvidia and AMD hardware, respectively). The recommended use case for the `parallel_for` launcher is:

```C++
#include "YAKL.h"
...
// Non-standard loop bounds
// for (int j=0; j < ny; j++) {
//   for (int i=1; i <= nx-1; i++) {
yakl::parallel_for( Bounds<2>(ny,{1,nx-1}) , YAKL_LAMBDA (int j, int i) {
  ...
});

// Multiple tightly nested loops
// for (int j=0; j<ny; j++) {
//   for (int i=0; i<nx; i++) {
yakl::parallel_for( Bounds<2>(ny,nx) , YAKL_LAMBDA (int j, int i) {
  c(i,j) = a(i,j) * b(j);
});

// A single loop
// for (int i=0; i<nx; i++) {
yakl::parallel_for( nx , YAKL_LAMBDA (int i) {
  c(i) = a(i)*b(i);
});
```

The `parallel_for` launcher is useful for every type of loop except for prefix sums and reductions. You can embed atomics in `parallel_for` as you'll see a few sections down.

### `Array`

The `Array` class is set up to handle two different memories: Host and Device, and you can seen an example of how to use these above as well as in the [miniWeather](https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather) codebase.

The `Array` class can be owned or non-owned. The constructors are:

```C++
// Owned (Allocated, reference counted, and deallocated by YAKL)
yakl::Array<T type, int rank, int memSpace, int style>(char const *label, int dim1, [int dim2, ...]);

// Non-Owned (NOT allocated, reference counted, or deallocated)
// Use this to wrap existing contiguous data pointers (e.g., from Fortran)
yakl::Array<T type, int rank, int memSpace, int style>(char const *label, T *ptr, int dim1, [int dim2, ...]);
```

* Valid values for `T` can be any `std::is_arithmetic<T>` type in `memDevice` memory and any class at all in `memHost` memory. On the host, `Array`s use the C++ "placement `new`" approach to call the contained class's constructor. This is not supported in device memory because it is less portable, and it requires Unified memory between host and device.
* Valid values for `rank` can be 1, 2, ..., 8
* Valid values for `memSpace` can be `memHost` or `memDevice` (default is `memDevice`)
* Valid values for `style` can be `styleC` or `styleFortran` (default is `styleC`)

Data is accessed in an `Array` object via the `(ind1[,ind2,...])` parenthesis operator with the right-most index varying the fastest for the C style `Array` (`yakl::styleC`) and the left-most index varying the fastest for the Fortran-style `Array` (`yakl::styleFortran`).

YAKL `Array` objects use shallow copies in the move and copy constructors. To copy the data from one `Array` to another, use the `Array::deep_copy_to(Array &destination)` member function. This will copy data between different memory spaces (e.g., `cudaMemcpy(...)`) for you depending on the memory spaces of the `Array` objects.

To create a host copy of an `Array`, use `Array::createHostCopy()`; and to create a device copy, use `Array::createDeviceCopy()`.

* `C` behavior only supports lower bounds of `0` for each dimension, and it has the right-most index varying the fastest in memory.
* `Fortran` behavior allows arbitrary lower bounds that defualt to `1`, and it has the left-most index varying the fastest in memory.

Both styles of `Array` only support data that is contiguous in memory.

### Moving Data Between Two Memory Spaces

The intent of YAKL is to mirror copies of the `Array` class between two distinct memory spaces: Host (i.e., main memory) and Device (e.g., GPU memory). There are currently four member functions of the `Array` class to help with data movement:

```C++
// Create a copy of this Array class in Host Memory, and pass that copy back as a return value.
Array<... createHostCopy();

// Create a copy of this Array class in Device Memory, and pass that copy back as a return value.
Array<...> createDeviceCopy();

// Copy the data from this Array pointer to the Host Array's pointer (Host Array must already exist)
void deep_copy_to(Array<T,memHost> lhs);

// Copy the data from this Array pointer to the Device Array's pointer (Device Array must already exist)
void deep_copy_to(Array<T,memDevice> lhs);
```

### `SArray` (and `YAKL_INLINE`)

To declare local data on the stack inside a kernel or stack data on the host that will be copied by value to the device, you'll use the `SArray` class for C-like behavior and the `FSArray` class for Fortran-like behavior. For instance:

```C++
typedef float real;
yakl::Array<real,memDevice> state("state",nx+2*hs);
yakl::Array<real,memDevice> coefs("coefs",nx,ord);

...

YAKL_INLINE void recon( SArray<real,ord> const &stencil , 
                        SArray<real,ord> &coefs ) {
  ...
}
                        
yakl::parallel_for( nx , YAKL_LAMBDA (int i) {
  // stencil and coefs are defined on the stack inside the kernel
  yakl::SArray<real,1,ord> stencil, coefsLoc;
  for (int ii=0; ii<ord; ii++) { stencil(ii) = state(i+ii); }
  // recon is callable from within a kernel because of the YAKL_INLINE prefix
  recon(stencil,coefsLoc);
  for (int ii=0; ii<ord; ii++) { coefs(i,ii) = coefsLoc(ii); }
  ...
});
```

`SArray` uses the following form:

```C++
SArray<type , num_dimensions , dim1 [ , dim2 , ...]> arrName;
```

* `type` should be kept to `std::is_arithmetic` types, though you can use classes with constructors at your own risk.
* `num_dimensions` is 1, 2, 3, or 4
* Number of dimensions provided after `num_dimensions` must match `num_dimensions`, or a compiler-time error will result.

Data is accessed in an `SArray` object via the `(ind1[,ind2,...])` parenthesis operator with the right-most index varying the fastest.

Note that `SArray` objects are inherently placed on the stack of whatever context they are declared in. Because of this, it doesn't make sense to allow a templated memory specifier (i.e., `yakl::memHost` or `yakl::memDevice`). Therefore, stack `Array` objects always have the `yakl::memStack` specifier. If used in a CUDA kernel, `SArray` objects will be placed onto the kernel stack frame. If used in CPU functions, they will be placed in the CPU function's stack. If defined on the host and used in a kernel, it will be copied by value to the device. Large `SArray` transfers from host to device will incur a large transfer cost.

## Fortran-style `Array`, `FSArray`, and Fortran-like `parallel_for` (Fortran Behavior in C++)

YAKL also has a Fortran-style `Array` and `FSArray` classes to make porting Fortran code to C++ simpler. It's time-consuming and error-prone to have to reorder the indices of every array to row-major and change all indexing to match C's always-zero lower bounds. Also, Fortran allows array slicing and non-one lower bounds, which can make porting very tedious. Look-up tables and intermediate index arrays and functions make this even harder.

The Fortran-style `Array` and `FSArray` classes allow any arbritrary lower bound, defaulting to one, and the left-most index always varies the fastest like in Fortran. You can create them as follows:

**Fortran-style `Array`**:
* `Array<float,2,yakl::memHost,yakl::styleFortran> arr( "label" , int dim1 , int dim2 )`
  * Equivalent to Fortran: `real, allocatable :: arr(:,:); allocate(arr(dim1,dim2))`
  * Creates an owned array
* `Array<float,1,yakl::memHost,yakl::styleFortran> arr( "label" , float *data_p , int dim1 )`
  * Equivalent to Fortran: `real, pointer :: arr(:); arr(:)->data(:)`
  * Same as before but non-owned (wraps an existing contiguous data pointer)
* `Array<double,2,yakl::memHost,yakl::styleFortran> arr( "label" , {-1,52} , {0,43} )`
  * Equivalent to Fortran: `real(8), allocatable :: arr(:,:); allocate(arr(-1:52 , 0:43)`
  * Lower and upper bounds are specified as C++ integer initializer lists
* `Array<double,2,yakl::memHost,yakl::styleFortran> arr( "label" , double *data_p , {-1,52} , {0,43} )`
  * Equivalent to Fortran: `real(8), pointer :: arr(:,:); arr(-1:,0:) -> data(:,:)`
  * Same as before but non-owned (wraps an existing contiguous data pointer)
* **slice()**: `using yakl::COLON;  Array... arr;  arr.slice<2>(COLON,COLON,ind1,ind2)`
  * Equivalent to Fortran array slicing: `arr(:,:,ind1,ind2)`
  * Only works on simple, *contiguous* array slices with *entire dimensions* (not partial dimensions) sliced out
    * E.g., `arr(0:5,4,7)`, though contiguous is not supported
  * If you want to **write** to the array slice passed to a function, you must save it as a temporary variable first and pass the temporary variable: E.g., `auto tmp = arr.slice<2>({COLON,COLON,ind1,ind2});  myfunc(tmp);`
    * This is because C++ treats objects returned by value as `const`
  * If you're only reading from the array slice, you can pass it directly inline because it obeys `const`
  * `slice()` always produces non-owned Fortran-style Arrays of the same type in the same memory space wrapping a contiguous portion of the host `Array`

**`FSArray`**:
`FSArray` uses the following form:

```C++
// Specify lower and upper bounds
FSArray<type , num_dimensions , SB<lb_1,ub_1> [ , SB<lb_2,ub_2> , ...]> arrName;

// Specify only upper bounds
FSArray<type , num_dimensions , SB<ub_1> [ , SB<ub_2> , ...]> arrName;

// Or specify some bounds as SB<lb,ub> and others as only SB<ub> in the same FSArray object
```

While the `SB<>` syntax admittedly looks messy, the `SB<lower_bound,upper_bound>` (or Static Bound) class is required to allow `FSArray` objects to have non-1 lower bounds, and C++ does not allow you to do this with prettier looking initializer lists like `{lb,ub}`. 

* Must template on the lower and upper bounds to place it on the stack.
* `FSArray<float,SB<-hs,hs>> stencil;`
  * Equivalent to the Fortran "automatic" array: `real :: stencil(-hs:hs)`
  * Low-overhead, placed on the stack, inherently thread-private in kernels

**`parallel_for` (Fortran style)**:
```C++
using yakl::Bounds;
yakl::parallel_for( Bounds<2>({-1,30,3},{0,29}) , YAKL_LAMBDA ( int j, int i ) {
  // Loop body
});
```

This is the parallel C++ equivalent of the following Fortran code:

```fortran
do j=-1,30,3
  do i=0,29
    ! Loop body
  enddo
enddo
```

Currently, backwards iterating is not supported, so `do` loops with a negative stride will need to be altered to have a positive stride.

**Fortran Intrinsics**:

There are a number of Fortran intrinsic functions available that can operate on Fortran-like `Array`s or `FSArray`s. For instance:

```C++
Array<float,2,memDevice,styleFortran> arr("arr",5,5);
std::cout << shape(arr);
std::cout << size(arr,2);
std::cout << sum(arr);
if (allocated(arr)) { ... }
if (associated(arr)) { ... }
// etc.
```

### Managed Memory

To use CUDA Managed Memory or HIP pinned memory, add `-D__MANAGED__` to the compiler flags. This will make your life much easier when porting a Fortran code to a GPU-enabled C++ code because all data allocated with the Fortran hooks of YAKL will be avilable on the CPU and the GPU without having to transfer it explicitly. However, it is always recommended to handle the transfers yourself eventually for improved efficiency. 

### Pool Allocator

An easy-to-use, self-contained, automatically growing C++ pool allocator optimized for stack-like allocations and deallocations with fortran bindings and hooks into OpenMP offload and OpenACC, CUDA Managed memory, and HIP.

* The pool allocator responds to environment variables to control the initial allocation size, growth size, and block size
* No segmentation for stack-like allocations and deallocations for efficient use of limited memory space.
* Warns the user if allocations are left allocated after the pool is destroyed to help the user debug the infamous "double free" error.

#### Why Use A Memory Pool?

In most of our codes in weather and climate, the reason we need a pool allocator on GPUs is that the native `cudaMalloc` and `hipMalloc` for Nvidia and AMD GPUs (presumably Intel will fall into this category as well) have extremely large runtimes that scale with the size of the allocation. This is for two reasons: (1) `cudaMalloc` is basically a system-level call, and (2) there is no Operating System layer on GPUs to manage a pool for us like we have in the Linux kernel in main system memory. Further, `cudaFree` and `hipFree` are synchronizing calls because they cannot deallocate memory while kernels are still using that memory. These issues combined make frequent intermittent malloc and free operations prohibitively expensive on GPUs, and the speed-up is usually reduced by at least 5x in our strong-scaled codes.

#### What Does "Stack-Like" Allocations and Deallocations Mean?

In weather and climate, we tend to allocate local data dynamically at the beginning of subroutines and then deallocate that data at the end of the subroutines. It ends up lookng like this:

```Fortran
subroutine parent()
   allocate(parent_a(...))
   allocate(parent_b(...))
   call child1()
   call child2()
   ! do work
   deallocate(parent_a))
   deallocate(parent_b))
end subroutine parent

subroutine child1()
   allocate(child1_data(...))
   ! do work
   deallocate(child1_data)
end subroutine child1

subroutine child2()
   allocate(child2_data(...))
   ! do work
   call grandchild()
   deallocate(child2_data)
end subroutine child2

subroutine grandchild()
   allocate(grandchild_data(...))
   ! do work
   deallocate(grandchild_data)
end subroutine randchild
```

If you follow the order of allocations and deallocations in that code, it's very close to a stack:

* `allocate(parent_a(...))`
* `allocate(parent_b(...))`
  * `allocate(child1_data(...))`
  * `deallocate(child1_data)`
  * `allocate(child2_data(...))`
    * `allocate(grandchild_data(...))`
    * `deallocate(grandchild_data)`
  * `deallocate(child2_data)`
* `deallocate(parent_a))`
* `deallocate(parent_b))`

You push allocations onto the back of the stack, and then your free allocations from the back of the stack (First In, Last Out). The most efficient memory allocator in terms of space efficiency and speed is, in fact, a stack. However, a stack **requires** you to deallocate in the reverse order that you allocate, and it can't be thread-safe. A stack-like allocator is more flexible. It allows you to allocate and deallocate in any order you want, and it can be made thread safe.

However, unlike a more general allocator like a Buddy Allocator (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation), the stack-like allocator here assumes the allocations and deallocations are **close** to stack-like behavior, and it optimizes for that case. In essence, new allocations can only be pushed to the end of the allocation list (there is no searching for gaps between previous allocations in the list), and when a pointer is deallocated, the search for the allocation for that pointer begins at the end of the allocation list and traverses backward.

With this assumption, any violation of stack-like behavior will incur linear search costs and additional segmentation. But for most of weather and climate, the behavior is very close to that of a stack.

#### Automatically Growing

Gator automatically allocates more space whenever it runs out of space for a requested allocation. This is done by adding additional pools to a list. The behavior is still the same as it was with a single pool in terms of allocation and deallcation searching. The new pools will remain in place for the duration of the simulation. Therefore, once a pool has grown, it does not need to grow again until the memory requirements reach a new memory high-water mark, which they rarely do in weather and climate after the first time step.

#### Informative

Gator keeps track of the memory high-water mark in the pool automatically and informs the user at the end of the simulation.

Error messages are made as helpful as possible to help the user know what to do in the event of a pool overflow. Sometimes, it is necessary to create a larger initial pool to use a limited memory space more effectively, and this guidance is given in error messages as errors occur.

Also, all allocations can be labeled with an optional string parameter upon allocation. This allows tracking of timestamped and labeled allocations that are written to a file in debug mode (**soon to be implemented**).

#### Environment variables 

You control the behavior of Gator's pool management through the following environment variables:

* `GATOR_INITIAL_MB`: The initial pool size in MB
* `GATOR_GROW_MB`: The size of each new pool in MB once the initial pool is out of memory
* `GATOR_BLOCK_BYTES`: The size of a byte. I can't imagine why you'd want to change this, but you can

Environment variables are advantageous because they allow easier adaptation to critical metrics like the number of processes per node or per GPU, which are easiest to calculate outside of the executable itself.

#### GPUs and Managed Memory

The following CPP defines control Gator's behavior as well:

* `-D__USE_CUDA__`: Enable CUDA allcoations (`cudaMalloc` and `cudaFree` are used to create and destroy the pools)
* `-D__USE_HIP__`: Enable HIP allocations (`hipMalloc` and `hipFree` are used to create and destroy the pools)
* `-D__MANAGED__`: Enable managed memory (`cudaMallocManaged` and `hipMallocHost` are used for CUDA and HIP, respectively, and the pools are pre-fetched to the GPU ahead of time for you), and inform OpenMP and OpenACC runtimes of this memory's Managed status whenever OpenACC or OpenMP are enabled. This is done automatically for OpenACC, but for OpenMP45, you'll need to specify a CPP define
* `-D_OPENMP45 -D__MANAGED__`: Tell the OpenMP4.5 runtime that your allocations are managed so that OpenMP doesn't try to copy the data for you (i.e., this lets the underlying CUDA runtime handle it for you instead). This only does anything if `-D__MANAGED__` is also specified.

### Synchronization

Currently YAKL only supports asynchronicity through the default CUDA stream. To synchronize the host code with code running on a GPU device, use the `yakl::fence()` functions which no-ops in host code and calls `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` on Nvidia GPUs and `hipDeviceSynchronize()` on AMD GPUs.

### Atomics

When you need atomic operations in YAKL, you can use the `atomicAdd`, `atomicMin`, and `atomicMax` routines. The most common use-case for atomics is some form of partial reduction over some of the indices of an array but not all. For example:

```C++
yakl::Array<real,4,memDevice> :: arrLarge("arrLarge",nz,ny,nx,ncrm);
yakl::Array<real,2,memDevice> :: arrSmall("arrLarge",nz,ncrm);

...

// for (int k=0; k<nzm; k++) {
//   for (int j=0; j<ny; j++) {
//     for (int i=0; i<nx; i++) {
//       for (int icrm=0; icrm<ncrms; icrm++) {
yakl::parallel_for( Bounds<4>(nzm,ny,nx,ncrms) , YAKL_LAMBDA (int k, int j, int i, int icrm) {
  // The operation below is a race condition in parallel. It needs an atomicMax
  // arrSmall(k,icrm) = max( arrSmall(k,icrm) , arrLarge(k,j,i,icrm) );
  yakl::atomicMax( arrSmall(k,icrm) , arrLarge(k,j,i,icrm) );
});
```

As a rule, if you ever see anything on the left-hand-side of an `=` with **fewer indices than you have surrounding loops**, then you're going to have a race condition that requires an atomic access.

### Reductions (Min, Max, and Sum)

The best way to do reductions is through the YAKL intrinsic functions `sum`, `max`, and `min`; which each take a single `Array` parameter of any memory space, style, type, or rank. E.g., `min(arr)`, where `arr` is an `Array` on the device will perform a minimum reduction of the data efficiently on the accelerator device and then pass the result back to the host. The routines below are available for performing reductions on general contiguous pointers of data OR if you need to keep the result of the reduction on the device and avoid the copy of the result back to the host.

YAKL provides efficient min, max, and sum array reductions using [CUB](https://nvlabs.github.io/cub/) and [hipCUB](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipCUB) for Nvidia and AMD GPUs. Because these implementations require temporary storage, a design choice was made to expose reductions through class objects. Upon construction, you must specify the size (number of elements to reduce), type (`template <class T>`) of the array that will be reduced, and the memory space (via template parameter, `yakl::memHost` or `yakl::memDevice`) of the array to be reduced. The constructor then allocates memory for the temporary storage. Then, you run the reduction on an array of that size using `T operator()(T *data)`, which returns the result of the reduction in host memory. When the object goes out of scope, it deallocates the data for you. The array reduction objects are not sharable and implements no shallow copy. An example reduction is below:

```C++
Array<float> dt3d;
// Fill dt3d
yakl::ParallelMin<float,yakl::memDevice> pmin( nx*ny*nz );
dt = pmin( dt3d.data() );
```

If you want to avoid copying the result back to the host, you can run the `void deviceReduce(T *data, T *rslt)` member function, where the `rslt` pointer is allocated in device memory. An example is below:

```C++
Array<float> dt3d;
float *dtDev;
// Allocate dtDev on device
// Fill dt3d
yakl::ParallelMin<float,yakl::memDevice> pmin( nx*ny*nz );
pmin.deviceReduce( dt3d.data() , dtDev );
```

As a rule, if you ever see a scalar on the left-hand and right-hand sides of an `=`, then it's a race condition in parallel that you will need to resolve by using a reduction.

### `ScalarLiveOut`

When you write to a scalar in a device kernel and need to subsequently read that value on the host, you encounter a "scalar live-out" scenario, and some compilers even tell you when this happens (though some do not). This happens most often in the following scenario:

* __Testing routines__: You pass through some data and determine whether it's realistic or not, assigning this to a `bool` that is read on the host later to report the error.

These situations are reductions in nature, but often it's not convenient or efficient to express them as reductions. 

In these cases, the scalar must be explicitly allocated in device memory, the initial scalar value transferred from host to device memory, the scalar value altered in the kernel, and the scalar value transferred from device to host memory after the kernel. `ScalarLiveOut` handles all of this for you as follows:

```C++
// Creates a bool scalar that is allocated in device memory
// and has an initial value of false (which is transferred
// to device memory for you in the constructor)
yakl::ScalarLiveOut<bool> dataIsBad(false);

yakl::c::parallel_for( yakl::c::Bounds<2>(ny,nx) ,
                       YAKL_LAMBDA (int j, int i) {
  // The ScalarLiveOut class overloads operator=, so you can
  // simply assign to it like any other scalar inside a kernel
  if (density(j,i) < 0 || pressure(j,i) < 0) {
    dataIsBad = true;
  }
});

// To read on the host after a kernel, use the hostRead()
// member function, which transfers the value to the host for you
if (dataIsBad.hostRead()) {
  std::cout << "ERROR: Invalid density or pressure!\n";
  throw ...
}
```

**When to not use `ScalarLiveOut`:** If you find yourself wanting to use atomics on a scalar, often times you're better off using a reduction instead, because all of the data is being reduced to a single scalar value. To facilitate this, it's best to create a temporary array with all necessary calculations (e.g., `dt3d` for the stable time step at each cell in a 3-D grid), and then perform a reduction on that array. While there is an `operator()` to expose the scalar for reading on the GPU, if you're needing to do this, there is usually an easier solution to you problem.

### Fortran - C++ interoperability with YAKL: `Array` and `gator_mod.F90`

We provide the `gator_mod` Fortran module to interface with YAKL's internal device allocator. To use it, you'll first need to make all "automatic" fortran arrays into `allocatable` arrays and explicitly allocate them:

```Fortran
real var1( lbnd_x:ubnd_x , lbnd_y:ubnd_y , lbnd_z:ubnd_z )
real var2(nx,ny,nz)
```

will become: 

```Fortran
real, allocatable :: var1(:,:,:)
real, allocatable :: var2(:,:,:)
...
allocate(var1( lbnd_x:ubnd_x , lbnd_y:ubnd_y , lbnd_z:ubnd_z ))
allocate(var2(nx,ny,nz))
...
deallocate(var1)
deallocate(var2)
```

Next, to interface with `gator_mod`, you'll need to transform all `allocatables` into `pointer, contiguous`. The `contiguous` attribute is recommended because some compilers will perform more optimizations on Fortran pointers when it is present. The resulting code is:

```Fortran
use gator_mod, only: gator_allocate, gator_deallocate

real, pointer, contiguous :: var1(:,:,:)
real, pointer, contiguous :: var2(:,:,:)
...
call gator_allocate( var1 , (/ ubnd_x-lbnd_x+1 , ubnd_y-lbnd_y+1 , ubnd_z-lbnd_z+1 /) , &
                            (/ lbnd_x , lbnd_y , lbnd_z /) )
call gator_allocate( var2 , (/nx,ny,nz/) )
...
call gator_deallocate(var1)
call gator_deallocate(var2)
```

Note that YAKL **does** support non-1 lower bounds in Fortran in `gator_allocate()`. The first set of indices specify the total extents of each dimension. The second set of indices specify the lower bounds of each dimension in case they aren't the default 1 lower bounds of Fortran. No, it's not the most convenient looking syntax for the user, but it is easier to implement this way :).

If a Fortran routine uses module data, when porting to C++, it is often easiest to mirror the Fortran practice. In this case, it is best to pass to allocate the Fortran data with `gator_allocate` and then immediately pass it to a C++ wrapping function, which will wrap it in unmanaged (non-owned) YAKL `Array` classes. With the above data, you will have the following code to do that:

```Fortran
module cpp_interface_mod
  use iso_c_binding
  interface
    subroutine wrap_arrays(var1,var2) bind(C,name="wrap_arrays")
      implicit none
      real(c_float), dimension(*) :: var1, var2
    end subroutine wrap_arrays
  end interface
contains
  ! All scalars can be directly bound to C
  real(c_float) , bind(C) :: scalar1, scalar2, scalar3
  
  ! Parameters cannot use bind(C), but rather must be replicated in
  ! a C++ header file with the constexpr keyword
  integer(c_int), parameter :: nx=DOM_NX, ny=DOM_NY, nz=DOM_NZ
  integer(c_int), parameter :: lbnd_x=-1, ubnd_x=nx+2
  integer(c_int), parameter :: lbnd_y=-1, ubnd_y=ny+2
  integer(c_int), parameter :: lbnd_z=-1, ubnd_z=nz+2
  
  ! Pass all arrays to a wrapper function to wrap them in Fortran-style Array objects in C++
  ! It's best to do this even for automatic arrays as well
  real(c_float) :: var1( lbnd_x:ubnd_x , lbnd_y:ubnd_y , lbnd_z:ubnd_z )
  real(c_float) :: var2( nx , ny , nz )
end module cpp_interface_mod
```

Fortran assumed size arrays (i.e., `dimension(*)`) are very convenient because an array of any dimension can be legally passed to the subroutine. Since Fortran passes by reference by default, the location of the data is passed to this array.

All variables in Fortran modules need to be moved to `iso_c_binding` types such as: `real(c_float)`, `real(c_double)`, `integer(c_int)`, and `logical(c_bool)`. All module-level scalars can directly be bound to C with `bind(C)`. Arrays, however, need to be passed to a wrapping routine.

In C++, you would have a header file, `fortran_data.h` with the following:

```C++
#pragma once

int constexpr nx=DOM_NZ;
int constexpr ny=DOM_NZ;
int constexpr nz=DOM_NZ;
int constexpr lbnd_x=-1; 
int constexpr lbnd_y=-1; 
int constexpr lbnd_z=-1; 
int constexpr ubnd_x=nx+2; 
int constexpr ubnd_y=ny+2; 
int constexpr ubnd_z=nz+2; 

typedef yakl::Array<float,3,yakl::memDevice,yakl::styleFortran> real3d;

extern "C" void wrap_arrays(float *var1, float *var2);

// Declare Array wrappers defined in fortran_data.cpp
extern real3d var1, var2;

// Declare external scalars defined in Fortran code
extern int scalar1, scalar2, scalar3;  

#endif
```

And you would have a source file, `fortran_data.cpp`, with:

```C++
#include "fortran_data.h"

real3d var1, var2;

extern "C" void wrap_arrays(float *var1_p, float *var2_p) {
  // These create un-owned YAKL Arrays using existing allocations from Fortran
  var1 = real3d( "var1" , var1_p , {lbnd_x:ubnd_x} , {lbnd_y:ubnd_y} , {lbnd_x:ubnd_x} );
  var2 = real3d( "var2" , var2_p , nx, ny, nz   );
}
```

Notice that because of the YAKL Fortran-style `Array` class, you do not need to change the way you index these arrays in the C++ code at all. It's column-major ordering like Fortran, it defaults to lower bounds of 1, and it supports non-1 lower bounds as well. In the end, you often have C++ code that looks nearly identical to your previous Fortran code, with the exception of any Fortran intrinsics not supported by YAKL.

Any time Fortran data is passed by parameter, you can use the un-owned `Array` constructors to wrap them just as seen above in the `wrap_arrays` functions. 

We've already seen how to pass Fortran arrays to C++. For scalars, though, consider the following Fortran function:

```fortran
module mymod
contains
  function blah(n,x,which,y) result(z)
    integer(c_int) , intent(in   ) :: n
    real(c_float)  , intent(in   ) :: x
    logical(c_bool), intent(in   ) :: which
    real(c_double) , intent(  out) :: y
    real(c_float)                  :: z
    ! code
    ! y = ...
  end function
end module
```

When you port this to C++, you'll change the Fortran code to the following:

```fortran
module mymod
  interface 
    function blah(n,x,which,y) result(z)  bind(C, name="blah")
      integer(c_int) , intent(in   ), value :: n
      real(c_float)  , intent(in   ), value :: x
      logical(c_bool), intent(in   ), value :: which
      real(c_double) , intent(  out)        :: y
      real(c_float)                         :: z
    end function
  end interface
contains
  ! You remove the code from here
  ! And you only put the function *header* above (no code)
end module
```

And you'll have a C++ function:

```C++
extern "C" float blah( int n , real x , bool which , double &y ) {
  // code
  // real y = ...
  return y;
}
```

Notice that in the Fortran interface, any scalar with `intent(in)` must be passed by value and not by reference (i.e., the `value` fortran keyword must be added). However, since the scalar `y` has `intent(out)`, we must pass it by reference, meaning we do not use the `value` keyword. On the C++ side of things, we accept `n`, `x`, and `which` as a simple `int`, `real`, and `bool`. But we accept `y` as `&y`, meaning when we change its value, the change lives outside the function like we want it to.

Regarding return values for functions, do not return a reference like you do with dummy arguments. If you added the `&` to the function return, you would essentially be returning a reference to a locally scoped variable, which won't have any meaning outside the function. The `iso_c_binding` handles things appropriately for you, so just return the appropriate type by value in C++, and map it to a simple return of the same type in the Fortran `interface` block.

The following table can help you convert Fortran parameter types to Fortran interfaces, and C++ dummy arguments:

| Fortran datatype                  | Fortran interface              | C++ dummy argument     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `integer(c_int), intent(in)`      | `integer(c_int), value`        | `int`                  |
| `real(c_double), intent(out)`     | `real(c_double)`               | `double &`             |
| `real(c_float), dimension(...)`   | `real(c_float), dimension(*)`  | `float *`              |
| `logical(c_bool), dimension(...)` | `logical(c_bool), dimension(*)`| `bool *`               |


### Interoperating with Kokkos

YAKL can interoperate with Kokkos in a number of ways. The YAKL `Array` is interoperable with the Kokkos `View` in the following contexts:

* `Array<T,memHost>` with neither `-D__USE_CUDA__` nor `-D__USE_HIP__`
  * This can be compatible with any dimension of Kokkos `View` in `HostSpace` with `LayoutRight` such as `View<T*,LayoutRight,HostSpace>` or `View<real****,LayoutRight,HostSpace>`
  * A good practice is to try to `typedef` YAKL `Array` objects to `real1d`, `real2d`, etc. and to try to keep those correct to the actual data being used. If you do this, you can easily map it to a Kokkos `View` of the correct dimension later, and you will get compile-time or run-time errors if you didn't do the dimensionality correctly.
* `Array<T,memDevice>` with `-D__USE_CUDA__`
  * This is compatible with any dimension of Kokkos `View<T*,LayoutRight,CudaSpace>`
* `Array<T,memDevice>` with `-D__USE_CUDA__ -D__MANAGED__`
  * This is compatible with any dimension of Kokkos `View<T*,LayoutRight,CudaUVMSpace>`
  
YAKL Fortran-style `Array` objects are compatible with Kokkos `View` objects in the same way that `Array` objects are, except that the lower bounds will be changed to zero, and the order of indexing will be reversed.

Both Kokkos and YAKL have unmanaged / un-owned multi-dimensional arrays, so you can wrap equivalent types using the data pointer, which each expose via `Array::data()` and `View::data()`

YAKL `parallel_for` launchers can use Kokkos `Views` without issue, and Kokkos `parallel_for` and `parallel_reduce` launchers can use YAKL `Array` objects without issue.

You can use Kokkos View data in YAKL's reductions via the `View::data()` pointer so long as the Kokkos `View` is congiguous, which you can determine via the `View::span_is_contiguous()` member function. It's prefereable for performance that the Kokkos `View` also have the `LayoutRight` attribute when interoperating with C-style YAKL `Array`s and the `LayoutLeft` attribute when interoperating with Fortran-style YAKL `Array`s

You can use YAKL atomic functions inside Kokkos `parallel_for` launchers. 

You can use YAKL `SArray` and `FSArray` objects inside Kokkos `parallel_for` launchers.

YAKL and Kokkos `fence()` operations are pretty much equivalent and can be used in either framework.

YAKL's `YAKL_INLINE` is equivalent to Kokkos's `KOKKOS_INLINE_FUNCTION`.

YAKL's `YAKL_LAMBDA` is similar to the Kokkos `KOKKOS_LAMBDA`, but there are important differences:
* In CUDA, YAKL specifies `#define YAKL_LAMBDA [=] __device__`, whereas Kokkos specifies `#define KOKKOS_LAMBDA [=] __host__ __device__`. YAKL differs here because of issues with calling atomics, which are only `__device__` functions in the hardware supported API. This will be a problem if trying to run `YAKL_LAMBDA` functions on the host, but that situation seems unlikely because explicitly creating a `YAKL_INLINE` function would seemingly suffice better in that case.
* On the host, YAKL specifies `#define YAKL_LAMBDA [&]`, wherease Kokkos specifies `#define KOKKOS_LAMBDA [=]`. This means that on the CPU, YAKL lambdas can capture by reference, but Kokkos lambdas cannot. In Kokkos, this is a benefit because it forces you to deal with GPU-specific annoyances from the start. In YAKL, it's a benefit because you can ignore that annoyance at first if you wish.

YAKL's build system in CMake simply takes the C++ files and tells CMake to compile them as if they were CUDA. You don't need to change the C++ compiler.

The Kokkos build system is more invasive and complex, requiring you to change the `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` for all files in the project to use the `nvcc_wrapper` shipped with the Kokkos repo, and compiling different source files depending upon CMake options you pass before adding the library. Theoretically, a CMake system using the Kokkos build requirements should handle the YAKL source files, but you probably can't use YAKL's normal CMake library. Integrating YAKL into a larger project should be very simple because YAKL's C++ interface only has two source files: `BuddyAllocator.cpp` and `YAKL.cpp`, and its Fortran interface only has one: `gator_mod.F90`.

## Compiling with YAKL

### CMake

To use YAKL in another CMake project, insert the following into your CMakeLists.txt

```cmake
add_subdirectory(/path/to/yakl  path/to/build/directory)
include_directories(/path/to/yakl)
include_directories(/path/to/build/directory)
```

The following variables can be defined before the `add_subdirectory()` command: `${YAKL_ARCH}`, `${CUDA_FLAGS}`, `${HIP_FLAGS}`, and `${YAKL_CXX_FLAGS}`. 

To compile YAKL for a device target, you'll need to specify `-DYAKL_ARCH="CUDA"` or `-DYAKL_ARCH="HIP"` for Nvidia and AMD GPUs, respectively. If you don't specify either of these, then YAKL will compile for the CPU in serial.

You can further specify `-DCUDA_FLAGS="-D__MANAGED__ -arch sm_70"` or other flags if you wish. if you omit these flags, YAKL will compile without Managed Memory and without a specific GPU target. If you use double precision `atomicAdd`, and you're using a modern Nvidia GPU (`sm_60` or greater), you will want to specify `-arch` to ensure good performance. Again, specify these before running the CMake `add_subdirectory` command.

You can specify `-DHIP_FLAGS="..."` to pass in more options to AMD's `hipcc` compiler.

If you specify `-DYAKL_ARCH="CUDA"`, then you **must** specify `-DYAKL_CUB_HOME=/path/to/cub`.

If you specify `-DYAKL_ARCH="HIP"`, then you **must** specify `-DYAKL_HIPCUB_HOME=/path/to/hipCUB -DYAKL_ROCPRIM_HOME=/path/to/rocPRIM`

After running the `add_subdirectory()` command, YAKL will export four variables into parent scope for you to use: `${YAKL_CXX_SOURCE}`, `${YAKL_F90_SOURCE}`, `${YAKL_SOURCE}`, and `${YAKL_CXX_FLAGS}`. The C++ flags are given to you since it's almost certain you'll need to compile C++ source files that link in YAKL headers, and these will needs those flags.

You can compile C++ files that use YAKL header files with the following:

```cmake
set_source_files_properties(whatever.cpp PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS "${YAKL_CXX_FLAGS}")
if ("${YAKL_ARCH}" STREQUALS "CUDA")
  set_source_files_properties(whatever.cpp PROPERTIES LANGUAGE CUDA)
endif()
```

For all targets including source files that use yakl, you will need to have the following:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(target_name yakl)
target_compile_features(target_name cxx_std_14)

You can, of course, specified a higher C++ standard so long as the features from that standard are supported by the vendor's compiler for the desired hardware backend.

Also, the YAKL source files are given to you in case you want to compile YAKL is a different way yourself, for instance, if the YAKL `CMakeLists.txt` isn't playing nicely with your own CMake build system for some reason. `add_subdirectory` will build the yakl library, but you're free to build a separate library with the YAKL source files in a different manner if you wish to.

### Traditional Makefile

You currently have three choices for a device backend: HIP, CUDA, and serial CPU. To use different hardware backends, add the following CPP defines in your code. You may only use one, no mixing of the backends. 

| Hardware      | CPP Flag       | 
| --------------|----------------| 
| AMD GPU       |`-D__USE_HIP__` | 
| Nvidia GPU    |`-D__USE_CUDA__`| 
| CPU Serial    | neither of the above two | 

Passing `-DARRAY_DEBUG` will turn on array index debugging for `Array`, `SArray`, and `FSArray` objects. **Beware** that this only works on host code at the moment, so do not pass `-DARRAY_DEBUG` at the same time as passing `-D__USE_CUDA__` or `-D__USE_HIP__`. The reason is that the CUDA and HIP runtimes do not currently support exception throwing.

Passing `-D__MANAGED__` will trigger `cudaMallocManaged()` in tandem with `-D__USE_CUDA__` and `hipMallocHost()` in tandem with `-D__USE_HIP__`.

Passing `-D__AUTO_FENCE__` will automatically insert a `yakl::fence()` after every `yakl::parallel_for` launch.

You will have to explicitly pass `-I/path/to/cub` if you specify `-D__USE_CUDA__`  and  `-I/path/to/hipCUB -I/path/to/rocPRIM` if you specify `-D__USE_HIP__`.

## Future Work

Please see the github Issues for planned future work on YAKL.

## Software Dependencies
* For Nvidia GPUs, you'll need to clone [CUB](https://nvlabs.github.io/cub/)
* For AMD GPUs, you'll need to clone:
  * [hipCUB](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipCUB)
  * [rocPIRM](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocPRIM)
